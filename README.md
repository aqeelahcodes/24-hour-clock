# 24-Hour Clock
A simple digital clock displaying military time or a 24-hour clock.

## Steps:
Step 1: Ran IDE Visual Studio Code with its built-in command line to create 1 folder containing 3 files index.html, style.css, and app.js   
Step 2: In HTML designed basic containers for 3 sections of the page and used other elements and attributes for targeting in CSS and JavaScript 
Step 3: In CSS removed default styles and created custom styles for the html elements and also imported fonts form Google 
Step 4: In JavaScript displayed the current time by using the Date() object with other methods to access the DOM and “if  statements”   
Step5: Deployed the app using GitHub Pages   

## Why the project is useful
The clock is one of the most important devices in civilization. 
Everything we know is dependent on time, whether it be your everyday routine, TV programming or travel.
